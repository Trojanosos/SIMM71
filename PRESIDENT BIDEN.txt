PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, it’s good to see you again. 
 
We’ve spent many hours together over the last 10 or 12 years.  And — and to host you in the United States is a great honor and a pleasure, particularly as it relates to our summit today and for the APEC Leaders’ Meeting this week.
 
Look, this time of year — about a year and a day ago, we met in Bali on the sidelines of the G20.  Since then, key members of our teams have had important discussions on issues — matters to both our nations and to the world. 
 
But as always, there is no substitute to face-to-face discussions.  I’ve always found our discussions straightforward and frank, and I’ve always appreciated them. 
 
Mr. President, we’ve known each other for a long time.  We haven’t always agreed, which was not a surprise to anyone, but our meetings have always been candid, straightforward, and useful.  I’ve never doubted what you’ve told me in terms of your candid nature in which you speak. 
 
I value our conversation because I think it’s paramount that you and I understand each other clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions or miscommunication. 
 
We have to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict.  And we also have to manage it responsibly — that competition. 
 
That’s what the United States want and what we intend to do.  We also — I also believe that’s what the world wants from both of us: candid exchange. 
 
We also have a responsibility to our people and the work — and the world to work together when we see it in our interest to do so. 
 
And the critical global challenges we face, from climate change to counternarcotics to artificial intelligence, demand our joint efforts. 
 
So, I look forward to beginning this discussion.  And I welcome you. 
 
And the floor is yours, Mr. President.  And, again, welcome back.
  
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.

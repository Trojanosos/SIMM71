1	Thank you for joining us. Here are the key takeaways from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech to a dinner of business executives at the APEC summit in San Francisco:Xi said China wants to be friends with the US and the Asian nation won’t fight a cold or hot war with anyone, in one of his clearest remarks yet proclaiming a desire for peaceful ties between the world’s two largest economiesChina is keen to promote people-to-people ties with the US, Xi said, announcing a push to invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs over the next five yearsOn a core area of difference, namely how the two countries fundamentally see each other, Xi asked: “Are we competitors or partners?” He added China is ready to be a partner and friend of the USXi devoted large part of speech highlighting the positives between the two countries, including praising the American people and the qualities they share, calling them “kind, friendly, hardworking and down-to-earth”The Chinese leader reiterated willingness to cooperate with the US across various fields, including the fight against fentanyl, calling it an issue where “China sympathizes deeply with the American people”Colum MurphyAsia Government TeamCopied	16th November

The heads of the world’s two largest economies met for over four hours on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in California. Here’s Bloomberg News story on what the two leaders agreed to: Here’s Everything Biden, Xi Agreed to at High-Stakes Summit #lazy-img-404404938:before{padding-top:66.64999999999999%;} Xi Jinping and Joe Biden in Woodside, California.

3	Either recounting a friendly history or reiterating China’s peaceful growth strategy, Xi’s making an effort today to appease rising concerns over a US-China “decoupling.”    After three decades of growing trade between China and the West, leaders and businesses in Washington and Brussels are looking to pull back, worried that China’s dominant role as the world’s workshop has created gaping imbalances.    Here’s how that decoupling -- a reduction in economic inter-dependence -- could play out. Alex MillsonSenior Editor, News DeskCopied	16th November

49	Just chatting here with colleagues about Biden’s earlier “dictator” remark and how the Chinese side could react. It just serves to underscore how fragile the relations between the two countries are if a single word could reverse any modest progress made. For sure, the comment isn’t going to sit well with Beijing. But they’ll probably let it slide and chalk it up to Biden trying to appeal to domestic audiences. Colum MurphyAsia Government TeamCopied	15th November
50	In his remarks to kick off the APEC summit, Biden mentioned earlier today that he shared with Xi Jinping a photo taken of the Chinese leader decades earlier at the Golden Gate Bridge. Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying posted the moment of bonhomie on X shortly before Biden’s press briefing, where he again repeated that Xi was a “dictator.”         Daniel Ten KateAsia Economy & Government Executive EditorCopied	15th November
51	As the dinner is about to start, nine out of the ten top trending topics on China’s microblogging platform Weibo are related to the Xi-Biden meeting.    One of the trending stories is that President Biden pointed to Xi’s official FAW Hongqi (red flag) car and said “beautiful” when they bid each other goodbye. Weibo Chief Executive Officer Wang Gaofei reposted the story and quipped: Advertisement of the day.  Zibang XiaoEconomy & Government TeamCopied	15th November

That would clearly signal an end to a commercial freeze in Boeing’s top export market.As of 7:30 p.m. PST there has been no announcement from Beijing, there is still time while Xi is in the US -- and Boeing’s Deal present for dinner could help to push the agenda along -- for a much-anticipated announcement.Danny LeeAsia Transport ReporterCopied	15th November

60	Early Republican criticism to the Biden-Xi meeting came from Senator Jim Risch, the top GOP member of the Foreign Relations Committee, who said Biden “narrowed the space for bipartisan cooperation” with China and downplayed the significance of the talks.       “China is not a normal country – it is an aggressor state,” Risch said in a statement. “Biden is caving to Xi in exchange for a series of meaningless working groups and engagement mechanisms.”   While Republican criticism was to be expected, it underscores the political challenge of reaching out to China, particularly just ahead of presidential elections in 2024.  Bill FariesSenior EditorCopied	15th November
61	Biden’s fresh remarks on Xi being a dictator come a week after Hillary Clinton criticized the Chinese leader’s decision to hold on to power for longer than the two terms of his predecessors. Speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, Clinton said Xi’s decision to remain in office had created challenges for China and its relations with the US. She said she hoped the Biden-Xi meeting would “reset the table.” We’ll now need to wait and see what China’s reaction will be to Biden’s unscripted comment.         Alex MillsonSenior Editor, News DeskCopied	15th November
62	Here are the key takeaways from Joe Biden’s news conference following his meeting with Xi Jinping in California:Biden capped the event by taking extra questions on his way out, responding to one with the comment that Xi is a dictator, describing China’s communist system as “totally different than ours.” The remark is likely to dominate headlines and frustrate the administration’s Chinese counterpartsUp until then, Biden hailed the talks as some of the most productive he’s had with Xi, describing areas of progress including resuming military-to-military communications The possibility of interference in Taiwan’s upcoming elections came up during Biden’s conversation with Xi. Biden said he made it clear to Xi he expects there to be no interferenceBiden hailed an agreement with China to counter the flow of fentanyl, a drug manufactured and produced by Chinese chemical companies. China is taking actions to prevent raw materials of the drug, known as precursors, from being exported with controlsThe president weighed in on the war in the Middle East, saying he is “mildly hopeful” about securing the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. He also said a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine is “the only ultimate answer” to ending the warAkayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopiedUpdated Nov 16	15th November
63	Here is the quote. When asked by a reporter whether he would still refer to Xi as a dictator, Biden said:      “Well, look, he is. I mean he’s a dictator in the sense that here’s a guy who runs a country that is a Communist country based on a form of government totally different than ours.” Colum MurphyAsia Government TeamCopiedUpdated Nov 15	15th November
64	How the press conference started: Biden hailed what he described as some of the most constructive and productive discussions he has had with Xi. How the press conference ended: Biden said Xi is a dictator.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November

66	The Chinese Foreign Ministry said earlier this week that China was looking for the US side to do more than just say it doesn’t support Taiwan independence. “The US needs to honor its commitment to one China and oppose ‘Taiwan independence’ with concrete actions,” spokeswoman Mao Ning said.Colum MurphyAsia Government TeamCopied	15th November
67	On Taiwan, it doesn’t seem like today’s talks moved the dial much, other than both sides pushing their respective lines. In truth both Beijing and Washington are treading water on this issue until there’s clarity on how the Taiwan presidential election goes in January, which will set the tone for where next on that issue.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
68	Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have said that is not their intention.Daniel FlatleyNational Security ReporterCopied	15th November
69	“I made it clear to the Israelis” that it’s a “big mistake” for them to continue to occupy Gaza, the president said. “I don’t think that works.”Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopied	15th November
70	Biden said he’s doing everything in his power to get hostages out of Gaza, but that does not involve sending a military presence, clarifying previous comments he made about the situation.Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopied	15th November
71	He wrapped up, before the extra questions, with another warning about the threat posed by Hamas and asked what would the US do. He adds he is negotiating to get hostages released, through a pause in fighting to allow that to happen.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
72	Before that, a relatively significant portion of the briefing was devoted to Israel-Hamas, which meant we didn’t really get into the nitty gritty of what was achieved during the US-China talks, apart from items already telegraphed earlier in the week such as cooperation on fentanyl, AI and climate.Colum MurphyAsia Government TeamCopied	15th November
73	The president took more questions from reporters than expected before leaving the stage, calling on a handful of journalists who asked shouted questions. As mentioned, that’s when the dictator question emerged. Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopiedUpdated Nov 16	15th November
74	In August, Biden made off-the-cuff remarks in another example of the US president veering off-script. As my colleague Justin Sink wrote at the time, the president blasted Communist Party leaders at a political fundraiser as “bad folks” and branded China’s economic problems a “ticking time bomb.”      Biden Calls China’s Economy ‘Ticking Time Bomb’ in New Barb Colum MurphyAsia Government TeamCopied	15th November
75	While Republican hard-liners are sure to blast Biden on many elements of his engagement with Xi, the dictator comment surely won’t be one of them.Chris AnsteySenior EditorCopied	15th November
76	It rather feels like the APEC meetings over coming days will be anti-climactic after this. But let’s see. It will be interesting to monitor how Biden and Xi interact with their colleagues. Back at the G-20 summit in Bali a year ago, there was a controversial encounter between Xi and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that got picked up on a hot mic. Let’s see what San Francisco brings.Chris AnsteySenior EditorCopied	15th November
77	The dictator remark will probably overshadow what looks like some cut-through on some very important areas, namely controlling fentanyl and on both militaries talking to each other. China may choose to ignore it... or not.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
78	The dictator comment is the sort of off-the-cuff comment from Biden that has stirred controversy in the past. His response came after the formal set of questions had been presented from the media. Reporters were shouting out questions to extend the briefing. Biden has made comments in the past about defending Taiwan and Russian “incursions” into Ukraine that forced White House staff to clarify what the president had intended.Chris AnsteySenior EditorCopied	15th November
79	The Chinese above all want respect. Biden was on message until the very last question, and the “dictator” remark will surely steal the headlines and irk Beijing. Daniel Ten KateAsia Economy & Government Executive EditorCopied	15th November
80	Biden previously referred to Xi as a dictator during a campaign fundraiser this summer, drawing rebukes from China.Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopied	15th November
81	He was answering in the affirmative a question on whether Xi is a dictator. As Akayla says, that off-script remark won’t go down well in Beijing.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November

83	Biden says Xi is a dictator, a comment that’s likely to upset the Chinese government.Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopiedUpdated Nov 15	15th November
84	Biden’s refusal to be drawn into further discussion on Taiwan - simply reiterating the so-called one-China policy - will be reassuring to Xi. Beijing will be looking for follow-through from US officials that they have no intention to change the status quo around the democratically run island.

85	Biden says that while he and Xi have their disagreements, the Chinese leader has been “straight” in his interactions with him. Colum MurphyAsia Government TeamCopied	15th November
86	Interesting to note that Biden kept his remarks on Taiwan so short. When asked in previous interviews, he has sometimes suggested the US might defend the island from an attack by China, prompting White House officials to walk back some of those comments. He’s now taking great care to stay on script.Daniel FlatleyNational Security ReporterCopied	15th November

113	The move to restart military-to-military communications is something the US has sought for months, but China has resisted - in part because the US put sanctions on China’s former defense minister. That official has since been ousted in a corruption probe, but China has yet to name a replacement. Daniel Ten KateAsia Economy & Government Executive EditorCopied	15th November

117	The third area listed is the promise to cooperate on AI - this sounds quite vague given both are competing technology superpowers.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
118	Biden says he “appreciates” Xi’s commitment on curbing fentanyl. His hope with this deal surely is that he’ll get credit domestically for getting progress in battling what’s been a true scourge for the nation.

129	More on Glaser, the Indo-Pacific director at the German Marshall Fund, who says on Bloomberg TV that many of the agreements are simply about talking.

130	Well-known China watcher Bonnie Glaser tells Bloomberg Television there are clearly deliverables that have come out of today’s talks, but she cautions it remains to be seen how the enforcement goes.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
131	Fun fact: The first APEC summit was convened in Seattle, in 1993. President Bill Clinton elevated the forum to the leaders’ level on that occasion. As the 1990s rolled on, APEC summits became famous for all the leaders doing a group photo wearing the same type of shirt. Like, batik shirts in Indonesia.Chris AnsteySenior EditorCopied	15th November

133	Something to keep in mind is the example that Biden sets for US allies with this engagement. For the likes of Japan, say, the takeaway is that it’s a-ok to meet with Chinese counterparts and do deals. Ripple effects will emanate from this.Chris AnsteySenior EditorCopied	15th November
134	Biden asked China’s government to respect the electoral process in upcoming US elections. There has been concern that outside foreign actors, including from China and Russia, could seek to undermine the 2024 presidential election. Those fears have only intensified with artificial intelligence rapidly advancing. Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopied	15th November
135	Some color from earlier in the day, when Biden and Xi took a walk.         Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopied	15th November
136	China’s readout strikes a more positive tone but there are still a few digs in there high up on page one:          The world is divided into those seeking to “enhance solidarity and cooperation” and those who “cling to the zero-sum mentality, provoke rivalry and confrontation”         “For China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option. It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other”   That’s tacit criticism of the attempts by the US and its allies to treat China as a strategic competitor and rival through economic curbs mentioned earlier. Rebecca Choong WilkinsAsia Government & Politics CorrespondentCopiedUpdated Nov 15	15th November
137	To put today’s agreements in context, this afternoon at Harvard University, former Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker, now at Harvard and a senior fellow there, likened US-China competition to the rivalry and conflict between Britain and France in the 18th century. Sure, there were times when deals were done, even trade deals. But they also spent much time warring against each other. Tucker was discussing his new book, Global Discord: Values and Power in a Fractured World Order. Chris AnsteySenior EditorCopiedUpdated Nov 15	15th November
138	The English-language readout from China touches upon many familiar themes, including concerns over US export controls, investment screening and sanctions that Beijing says could “hurt China’s legitimate interests.” These issues come up often in discussions between US and Chinese economic officials and were again discussed last week when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held talks in San Francisco with her Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng. Both sides spoke of the need to have a level playing field, though it’s unlikely this means either would actually reconsider existing measures.

139	Looking ahead to this evening’s main event, Apple’s Tim Cook and BlackRock’s Larry Fink are set to attend a dinner with Xi, along with Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and Visa CEO Ryan McInerney, according to people briefed on the guest list. The soiree in San Francisco comes as Xi tries to woo foreign capital to the world’s second-largest economy.

140	It’s worth saying that, relative to where these relations were just six months ago, the talks today look to have covered a lot of ground and (on paper at least) have cut through on areas where both governments can cooperate, such as AI, curbing fentanyl and on climate change. The language on Taiwan appears to be what we are used to hearing. There’s plenty to digest in terms of what all of this will mean.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
141	The US is describing China’s agreement to curtail fentanyl production at specific companies as the most significant to come out of the meeting. Biden told Xi that fentanyl has caused one of the worst crises the country has ever endured, according to a senior administration official.Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopied	15th November
142	A quick perusal of the English language readout from China shows a lot of stock phrases that Xi uses. He spoke about changes unseen in a century, the need to avoid zero-sum mentality and of course the obligatory reference to win-win cooperation. Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
143	No surprises here. Xinhua says Xi told the US side that “export control, investment screening and unilateral sanctions seriously hurt China’s legitimate interests.”Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
144	So things are running a little behind schedule. We’re waiting for Biden to start a press conference at which he’ll flesh out the details of what has been agreed. Judging by his initial remark on X, it looks like the administration wants to portray these talks as a clear win. Needless to say, Biden will be solo - Xi won’t be giving a press conference.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
145	I expect a lot of reaction to make the point that agreements are one thing, execution is another. Only a year ago it looked like the US and China were back on track. Then, as Akayla mentioned, the balloon came.Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
146	Those comments from Biden on X don’t seem to chime with the hawkish mood in DC towards China, including from his own administration. Can this better tone last?Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
147	Biden described today’s meeting as “the most constructive and productive discussions” yet between the nations, nodding to months of preparation by their staffs. Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopiedUpdated Nov 15	15th November
148	In terms of olive branches, here’s the section in which China says both countries need to cooperate:     “China and the United States should lead by example, step up coordination and cooperation on international and regional issues, and provide more public goods for the world.” Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopiedUpdated Nov 15	15th November
149	First comment I’ve seen on Taiwan, again per Xinhua:“China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable.”Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
150	Today’s meeting was the first in-person engagement between Biden and Xi since a G-20 meeting in Bali last year. It’s taken some effort to get here, as tensions increased during the interim. The US discovered an alleged Chinese spy balloon flying in its airspace in February, alarming civilians and Congress. China’s wildlife agency recently ended its contracts for giant pandas to American zoos without explanation. And travels by US lawmakers to Taiwan have drawn rebukes from China.Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopied	15th November
151	As expected, Xi laid out his own boundaries during the meeting, according to Xinhua, citing the Chinese leader:“China has interests that must be safeguarded, principles that must be upheld, and red lines that must not be crossed.”Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopiedUpdated Nov 15	15th November
152	Hours before the talks began, both governments released a statement detailing new commitments to cooperate on climate change with promises to build carbon-capture facilities, curtail power sector pollution and take aim at the full suite of greenhouse gases helping warm the planet - one of the areas long identified for cooperation between both governments.

153	A note of caution here. Whatever the deliverables from the Xi-Biden meeting, their effects may not be lasting. Eurasia Group analysts wrote in a recent note:     “Heading into 2024, there is rising risk that Taiwan’s election will set back the progress made. China also knows that Biden’s ability to deliver progress will be constrained not only by his administration’s perception that the relationship is fundamentally competitive, but also by election year politics and a hawkish Congress.”  Colum MurphyAsia Government TeamCopied	15th November
154	Here’s some more from the Xinhua readout on the people-to-people exchanges, citing Xi:“The two sides should increase direct flights, advance tourism cooperation, expand subnational exchanges, strengthen educational cooperation, and encourage and support greater interactions and communication between their people.”Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
155	The potential for more flights between both countries will come as a relief for business people, students and tourists who have been struggling with limited capacity ever since the Covid pandemic eased. Here’s the line that Xinhua ran on the flights:     “Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed Wednesday to commit to working toward a significant further increase in scheduled passenger flights early next year.” Enda CurranGlobal Economy ReporterCopied	15th November
156	The Biden administration has pursued an industrial strategy aimed at building manufacturing capacity at home and diversifying supply chains. At the same time, it’s been limiting not just advanced chips that can be exported to China but chip-making equipment and design software as well. The US is also seeking to cut off funding: An executive order signed this year imposes limits on US investments in some Chinese semiconductor, quantum computing and artificial intelligence firms.

157	China also needs continued inflows of foreign investment to sustain economic growth and to deliver the jobs and prosperity that underpin the Communist Party’s legitimacy. Zibang XiaoEconomy & Government TeamCopied	15th November
158	Stabilizing the relationship with Washington allows Xi to better focus on domestic challenges. China’s economy was expected to come roaring back once strict pandemic control measures were lifted in December. But after an initial burst, momentum quickly petered out, weighed down by a crisis in the all-important property sector.Zibang XiaoEconomy & Government TeamCopied	15th November
159	Here’s what we know already about deliverables from the meeting:China and the US agreed to resume military-to-military communicationsThe Chinese government will crack down on the flow of fentanyl, an illicit drug that Biden’s political opponents have focused in on as trafficking increases in the USThe leaders committed to hold discussions about the potential risks of artificial intelligence, particularly its use in defense modernizationBiden, Xi Strike Deals on Fentanyl, Military Communications (1)Akayla GardnerWhite House ReporterCopiedUpdated Nov 15	15th November
160	Biden met with Xi, along with their top aides, for a bilateral meeting earlier today that lasted approximately two hours. The leaders also sat for a “working lunch” with a much smaller group of staffers, and went for a one-on-one stroll on the grounds of the Filoli estate south of San Francisco. We’ll be awaiting details of the conversation between the two leaders, which both countries describe as the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world.
